global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of some type of extreme weather.
from the analysis we have gathered useful insights over the past 10 years for example warming
is causing more rain to fall in heavy downpours. there are also longer dry period between
rainfalls this coupled with more evaporation due to higher temperatures.we place have
generally become wetter, while dry place have become drier.
